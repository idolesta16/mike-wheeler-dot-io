## Work Experience
### Health Data Analytics Institute (July 2019 to present)
I'm designing and implementing an API for delivering model predictions to clients in healthcare with a focus on 
extensibility across different algorithms and data formats. I'm also applying dimensionality reduction techniques in 
SAS to better understand the relationships between broad sets of disease codes and a smaller set of chronic conditions 
in US Medicare data.

### Boston Microgreens (December 2018 to April 2019)
I served as Lead Software Engineer for a team of six developers. I led sprint meetings, managed team workflow across
Github and Slack, and collaborated with the CEO to hire two co-ops for the Fall semester. Under my leadership the team 
developed a minimum viable solution for greenhouse inventory management in eight weeks.

### Solaria Labs, Liberty Mutual (July to December 2018)
I worked on the expansion of the Total Home Score project, leveraging cutting-edge data processing and visualization 
tools to create a quality assurance solution scaled to over 50 million new addresses. I also integrated the Dask 
and Luigi libraries in Python to achieve the efficient distributed execution of data pipelines on larger-than-memory 
datasets.

### Computational Modeling in Chemical Engineering, Northeastern University (January to April 2017)
I did a semester of directed research, improving the data representations backing a Django solution used by researchers 
to catalogue and predict complex chemical kinetics.

### Acoustic Communications Group, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (July to August 2017 and 2018)
I conducted hardware and firmware testing of acoustic device prototypes, and maintained a testing framework which
included a Django app to display results. I also collaborated with engineers on a rudimentary data pipeline to 
preprocess sonar recordings for a system developed under DARPA's Future Arctic Sensing Technologies project.

## Volunteer Experience
### Boston Public Market
I manned the info desk, assisted visitors, and provided support for special events.

### Boston Housing Authority
I answered the Spanish line, translating requests for maintenance and application status checks from Boston residents 
to Housing Authority staff. I also occasionally did live interpreting for community events and for meetings with 
Housing officers.

### Eagle Scout Project
I led a crew in the removal of over 200 golf balls from old driving range as part of its conversion to a public park. My
crew also cleaned up invasive species and saved a tree from a vine grown three inches thick.

## Other Experience
### Hackathons
- HackBeanpot 2019 â€” won the "Hack to Give Back" Award
- HackUMass 2018
- BostonHacks 2017, 2018
- HuskyHacks 2016

### Continuing Education
