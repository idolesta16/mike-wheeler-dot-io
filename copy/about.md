# About Me

Hello, I'm Michael Wheeler. I'm an undergraduate majoring in Data Science at Northeastern University in Boston, MA. 
While living on the Cape I earned the title of Eagle Scout in Troop 38 and the Roll of Honor at Falmouth High School. 
Then in the Fall of 2016 I came to Boston with a full-tuition scholarship to under the University Scholars program. 
Since enrolling I have given over three hundred hours of service to communities in Boston and elsewhere under the Civic 
Engagement Program. I have also completed a minor in Math and will most likely graduate in early 2021.

I'm hardworking and willing to put in the extra mile where it counts. I'm also creative and forward-thinking: my mind 
brims with ideas and brainstorming comes naturally to me. I believe that creating good software is interdisciplinary: a 
balance of modeling (math), performance (engineering), repeatability (science), and expressiveness (language). I also 
believe that data is about storytelling and understanding the real people whose lives are behind the numbers. In an 
increasingly digital world I place more value on experiences shared in real life â€” with this comes a conscious choice 
not to use no social media. Instead you'll find me enjoying live music, conversing with close friends, and learning 
about current events and world cultures from sources like the New York Times and the Washington Post.
