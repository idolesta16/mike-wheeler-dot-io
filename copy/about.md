# About Me

Hello, I'm Michael Wheeler. I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Data Science at Northeastern University in Boston. 
In the Fall of 2016 I came to Northeastern with a full-tuition scholarship as a member of the University Scholars 
program. Since then I have completed one co-op with another in progress and earned a minor in Math. I have 
also given over three hundred hours of service to communities in Boston and elsewhere as part of Northeastern's Civic 
Engagement Program.

I'm a creative and forward-thinking individual with a deep sense of responsibility for the things I create. To me,
good software is interdisciplinary: a balance of modeling (math), performance (engineering), repeatability (science), 
and expressiveness (language). I also believe that data is about storytelling and understanding the real people whose 
lives are behind the numbers. In an increasingly digital world I place greater value on experiences shared in real life 
â€” with this comes a conscious choice not to use no social media. Instead you'll find me enjoying live music, conversing 
with close friends, and learning about the world through journalism.
