# About Me

Hello, I'm Michael Wheeler. I'm an undergraduate majoring in Data Science at Northeastern University in Boston, MA. 
In the Fall of 2016 I came to Boston with a full-tuition scholarship to Northeastern under the University Scholars 
program. Since enrolling I have completed one co-op with another in progress and earned a minor in Mathematics. I have 
also given over three hundred hours of service to communities in Boston and elsewhere as part of Northeastern's Civic 
Engagement Program.

I'm a creative and forward-thinking individual: my mind brims with ideas and brainstorming comes naturally to me. To me,
good software is interdisciplinary: a balance of modeling (math), performance (engineering), repeatability (science), 
and expressiveness (language). I also believe that data is about storytelling and understanding the real people whose 
lives are behind the numbers. In an increasingly digital world I place more value on experiences shared in real life â€” 
with this comes a conscious choice not to use no social media. Instead you'll find me enjoying live music, conversing 
with close friends, and learning about current events and world cultures from sources like the New York Times.
