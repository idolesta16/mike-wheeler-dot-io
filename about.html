      <h2>In Brief</h2>
      <p>
       Hello! My name is Michael Wheeler. I was born and raised on Cape Cod and currently reside in Boston.
       I graduated from Falmouth High School in 2016, and currently study Data Science as an Undergraduate at 
       Northeastern University.

      <h2>What am I up to Now?</h2>
       <p>
       At the moment I am starting the search for my first co-op.
       (employers -- need a co-op for the Fall? check out my <a href"resume.html">resume</a>!)
       </p>
       <p> <!-- TODO -- make this a UL? -->
       I am also taking some of the most exciting courses of my college career so far. You'll find me
       "beating the odds" in <b>Probability and Statistics</b>, learning about SQL in <b>Database Design</b>,
       getting my feet wet with Big Data in <b>Data Collection, Integration, and Analysis</b>, and becoming 
       a Java master in <b>Object-Oriented Design</b>.
       </p>

        <summary>Guest Studies at WHOI</summary>
        <details>
         <p>
          Between July 2016 and August 2017 while not at school I worked as a Guest Student under the 
          <a href="acomms.whoi.edu">Acoustic Communications Group</a> at
          the <a href="whoi.edu">Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution</a> in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. 
          One project I had the privelige of contributing to was the brand-new WHOI 205118a -- a low-power solution 
          that makes use of Intel's Edison module to offer advanced control over Micro-modems and other acoustic 
          communications equipment during deployments. As the very first user of the 205118a, my work included
          testing and documenting its setup, configuration, and environmental limits and providing 
          feedback based on my results; as well as prepping boards for initial shipments to some of the Group's partners.
