          <h2 class="section-header">Who I Am</h2>
          <p>
              I am a third-year Data Science major and University Scholar at Northeastern University.
          </p>
          <p>
              I am a lifetime resident of Massachusetts, born and raised on Cape Cod.
          </p>
          <p>
              I am a photographer. I am a cook. I am an Eagle Scout.

          <h2 class="section-header">What I Believe</h2>
          <p>
              I believe in the art and the joy of computer programming.
          </p>
          <p>
              I believe in small data and its hidden power.
          </p>
          <p>
              I believe that the purpose of technology is to enhance the human experience, not to replace it.
          </p>
          <p>
              I believe that intelligence is more than a single subject or a piece of paper.

          <h2 class="section-header">What I've been up to</h2>
          <p>
              Right now I'm finishing up my first co-op at Solaria Labs, an innovation incubator owned by
              Liberty Mutual Insurance.
          </p>
          <p>
              Soon I'll be starting classes for the spring semester. My courses are math-heavy this time around --
              Linear Algebra and Statistics and Stochastic Processes -- but I'm most excited for my
              data visualization class.
          </p>
          <p>
              I've also been working on BookTiger. The project is still in its very early stages so stay tuned.
          </p>
          <p>
              I'm starting collaborative work with Boston Microgreens. As their new Lead Software Developer I'm working to
              build tools that will enhance their growing operations.
