<!-- TODO put in one nice square picture of me -->

<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>
I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Data Science at Northeastern University in Boston.
In the Fall of 2016 I came to Northeastern with a full-tuition scholarship as a member of the University Scholars
program. Since then I have completed one co-op with another in progress and earned a minor in Math. I have
also given over 300 hours of service to communities in Boston and elsewhere as part of Northeastern's Civic
Engagement Program.
</p>

<p>
I'm a creative and forward-thinking individual with a deep sense of responsibility for the things I create. To me,
good software is interdisciplinary: a balance of modeling (math), performance (engineering), repeatability (science),
and expressiveness (language). I also believe that data is about storytelling and understanding the real people whose
lives are behind the numbers. In an increasingly digital world I place greater value on experiences shared in real life
â€” with this comes a conscious choice not to use social media. Instead you'll find me enjoying live music, conversing
with close friends, and learning about the world by supporting quality journalism.
