    <h1 class="section-header">About</h1>

    <p>
        I'm an undergraduate student majoring in
        <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/program/data-science-bs/" target="_blank">Data Science</a> at
        Northeastern University in Boston. In the Fall of 2016 I came to Northeastern with a full-tuition scholarship as
        a member of the
        <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/universityscholars/" target="_blank">University Scholars program</a>.
        Since then I have completed one co-op with another in progress and earned a minor in Mathematics. I have also
        given over 300 hours of service to communities in Boston and elsewhere as part of Northeastern's Civic
        Engagement Program.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm a creative and forward-thinking individual with a deep sense of responsibility for the things I create. To
        me, good software is interdisciplinary: a balance of modeling (math), performance (engineering), repeatability
        (science), and expressiveness (language). I also believe that data is about storytelling and understanding the
        real people whose lives are behind the numbers. In an increasingly digital world I place greater value on
        experiences shared in real life â€” with this comes a conscious choice not to use social media. Instead you'll
        find me dancing at concerts, conversing with close friends, and learning about the world by supporting quality
        journalism.</p>
    <p>
        You can however still find me on <a href="https://github.com/mikewheel" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

                        I traveled with service groups with Northeastern twice. The first trip was in 2017 to the Washita
                        Battlefield National Historic Site in Roger Mills County, Oklahoma where we worked on invasive
                        species removal and other land management tasks. The second was in 2018 to the Island School in
                        Eleuthera, The Bahamas where we assisted researchers with tagging sea turtles.
